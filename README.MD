# Sylas

Care to encrypt or decrypt some files? I can help.

Just set an environment variable on your system: `SYLAS_PATH`, to wherever you'd like me to send your keys and encrypted files.

Then... supply any `.txt` file to this projects root directory and talk to me.

Once you talk to me (run program), let me know the filename and action you'd like to take, I can set you up.

Don't worry, I'll delete the original unecrypted file when we're done.
